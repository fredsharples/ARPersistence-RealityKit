#  Saving and loading world data with RealityKit and SwiftUI

This project migrates the [Apple sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/world_tracking/saving_and_loading_world_data) from SceneKit to RealityKit and SwiftUI. 

I am new to SwiftUI, so feel free to leave comments or give suggestions.
